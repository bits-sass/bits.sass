# Bits.scss

A structural UI toolkit based on Nicolas Gallagher's SUIT and written using SASS.

Practically a fork of Nicolas Gallagher's [SUIT](https://github.com/suitcss) rewritten using [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
and considerably extended.

## Installation

__Bower:__ `bower install --save bits-scss`

This command installs all subpackages. See the list below.

## Packages

Each package is stand-alone, contains its own documentation and tests, and is written to follow
a common set of [naming conventions and authoring practices](docs/overview.md).
Dependencies are best managed using [Bower](http://bower.io) â€“ a package manager for the web.

## Features

**[Read about the design decisions and authoring principles of Bits.scss](docs/overview.md)**.

* Highly modular; each module is individually versioned.
* Provides common, low-level utility classes.
* Provides common structural UI patterns.
* Responsive grid.
* Consistent class name conventions.
* Work more with HTML than CSS.
* Theme-independence.
* Designed for large web sites and applications.
* Easy to build your application's custom toolkit on top of Suit.
* Very small footprint.


## Why?

* Monolithic UI frameworks don't make it easy to use, share, and version
  specific UI traits and components.
* Complex applications need to loosely couple content, document semantics, and
  presentational structure to make it easier to change any layer while minimizing the
  impact on other layers.
* Complex applications need to clearly surface and scope the relationship
  between all HTML classes (and their attached styles and behaviour).
* Complex applications can accumulate technical debt when components are not
  kept independent of one-another, or the dependencies aren't clear.


## How?

* Build progressive enhancement into the UI layers themselves. Use low-level
  utilities to build up a skeleton UI.
* Codify the separation of responsibilities by using structured class names
  that reflect different purposes and relationships.
* Provide clear, constrained, and explicit authoring principles.
* Use multiple classes in HTML templates to combine styles.
* Organize discrete UI features into small, standalone packages / files.
